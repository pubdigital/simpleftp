Psychedelic Porn Crumpets - Found God in a Tomato

[Verse 1]
I’m barely operating
Yet a functional being
I always seemed to be vacant
Parading myself as an abductee

[Verse 2]
Then one day I was transposed
From a simple young man
To a godly tomato that held all existence
And told me that we should expand

[Chorus]
And now the world will always revolve
Around me
I’ll wake up and I will always be fine
Now I know
Everything always will be easy
And the way I like
I’m grateful that I held that tomato
So it could change my life
'Cause I’m different
At least I thought so

[Verse 3]
What a triumphant occasion
How to change your design
That one thought has left my head on a pillow on my cloud nine
I wonder how many more fruits
Can connect to my head
I would take a papaya
Travel the world and the universe as two best friends

[Chorus]
And now the world will always revolve
Around me
I’ll wake up and I will always be fine
Now I know
Everything always will be easy
And the way I like
I’m grateful that I held that tomato
So it could change my life
Now 'cause I’m different
At least I thought so

[Bridge]
I've found it gets harder every
Time, I count backwards in my head
Time, I’m coming back with
Time, I’m coming back with
Time, I'm not here
I’m coming back with
I’m coming back with
I’m coming back with
All my life
All my life

[Chorus]
Around me
I’ll wake up and I will always be fine
Now I know
Everything always will be easy
And the way I like
I’m grateful that I held that tomato
So it could change my life
'Cause I’m different
At least I thought so
